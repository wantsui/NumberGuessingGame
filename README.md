### NumberGuessingVR


This is an in progress game using React VR for guessing a number done as practice! I am still learning how React works, so this is meant to be a very basic and simple game. The title might change, this is really just to practice programming with VR.

Please check back soon for more updates!

**To play:**

1) Click on a floating box.

2) The main text will change to: "Guess [number]!"

3) If this is your guess, press the text.
