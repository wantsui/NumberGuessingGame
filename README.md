### NumberGuessingVR


This is an in progress game using React VR for guessing a number done as practice! I am still learning how React and React VR works, so this is meant to be a very basic, silly, and simple game. I originally gave it a very plain and generic name of Number Guessing Game but it's been changed to NumberGuessingVR. The title will probably still change, this is really just to practice programming with VR.

Please check back soon for more updates!

**To play:**

1) Click on a floating box.

2) The main text will change to: "Guess [number]!"

3) If this is your guess, press the text.
